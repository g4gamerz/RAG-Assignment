Climate Change and Environmental Science

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns. While climate change is a natural phenomenon, scientific evidence shows that human activities have been the primary driver of climate change since the mid-20th century, mainly through the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas.

The Greenhouse Effect
The greenhouse effect is a natural process that warms Earth's surface. When the Sun's energy reaches Earth, some of it is reflected back to space, and the rest is absorbed by the land, oceans, and atmosphere. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, including carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor, trap some of the heat that would otherwise escape to space. This trapped heat keeps our planet warm enough to sustain life.

However, human activities have intensified the greenhouse effect by increasing concentrations of these gases in the atmosphere. The burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes release large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, causing global temperatures to rise.

Biodiversity and Ecosystems
Biodiversity refers to the variety of life on Earth, encompassing the diversity of species, ecosystems, and genetic variations within species. High biodiversity is crucial for ecosystem health, resilience, and the provision of essential services such as clean air, water, food, and climate regulation.

Climate change poses a significant threat to biodiversity. Rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and extreme weather events are altering habitats and forcing species to adapt, migrate, or face extinction. Coral reefs, Arctic ecosystems, and tropical rainforests are particularly vulnerable to these changes.

Deforestation and Land Use
Deforestation is the permanent removal of forests to make way for other land uses. The primary causes include agricultural expansion, logging for timber and paper products, infrastructure development, and urbanization. Deforestation has severe environmental consequences, including loss of biodiversity, disruption of water cycles, soil erosion, and increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

Forests play a critical role in regulating the Earth's climate by absorbing carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. When forests are cleared or burned, not only is this carbon-absorbing capacity lost, but the carbon stored in trees is released back into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change.

Ocean Acidification
Ocean acidification is the ongoing decrease in the pH of Earth's oceans, caused by the uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. As the ocean absorbs more CO2, chemical reactions occur that reduce seawater pH, making it more acidic. This process affects marine organisms, particularly those with calcium carbonate shells or skeletons, such as corals, mollusks, and some plankton species.

The impacts of ocean acidification can cascade through marine food webs, affecting fish populations and the communities that depend on them for food and livelihoods. Coral reefs, which support an estimated 25% of all marine species, are especially vulnerable to both warming waters and acidification.
